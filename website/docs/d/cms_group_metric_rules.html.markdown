# alicloud\_cms\_group\_metric\_rules

This data source provides the Cms Group Metric Rules of the current Alibaba Cloud user.

-> **NOTE:** Available in v1.104.0+.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terraform
data "alicloud_cms_group_metric_rules" "example" {
  ids        = ["4a9a8978-a9cc-55ca-aa7c-530ccd91ae57"]
  name_regex = "the_resource_name"
}

output "first_cms_group_metric_rule_id" {
  value = data.alicloud_cms_group_metric_rules.example.rules.0.id
}
```

## Argument Reference
