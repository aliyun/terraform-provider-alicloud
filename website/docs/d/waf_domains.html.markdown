data "alicloud_waf_domains" "default" {
  instance_id = "waf-cf-xxxxx"
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ids` - (Optional, ForceNew) A list of WAF domain names. Each item is domain name.
* `name_regex` - (Optional) A regex string to filter results by domain name.
* `instance_id` - (Required) The Id of waf instance to which waf domain belongs.
* `resource_group_id` - (Optional, Available in v1.94.0+) The ID of the resource group to which the queried domain belongs in Resource Management.
* `enable_details` - (Optional, Available in v1.94.0+) Default to false and only output `id`, `domain_name`. Set it to true can output more details.
* `output_file` - (Optional) File name where to save data source results (after running `terraform plan`).

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the arguments listed above:

* `ids` - A list of WAF domain self ID, value as `domain_name`.
* `names` - A list of WAF domain names. 
* `domains` - A list of Domains. Each element contains the following attributes:
  * `domain` - Field `domain` has been deprecated from version 1.94.0. Use `domain_name` instead.
  * `domain_name` - Name of the domain.
  * `id` - The ID of domain self ID, value as `domain_name`.
  * `cluster_type` - The type of the WAF cluster.
  * `cname` - The CNAME record assigned by the WAF instance to the specified domain.
  * `connection_time` - The connection timeout for WAF exclusive clusters. Valid values: `PhysicalCluster` and `VirtualCluster`. Default to `PhysicalCluster`.
  * `http2_port` - List of the HTTP 2.0 ports.
  * `http_port` - List of the HTTP ports.
  * `http_to_user_ip` - Specifies whether to enable the HTTP back-to-origin feature. After this feature is enabled, the WAF instance can use HTTP to forward HTTPS requests to the origin server.

     * `key`: The key of label.
     * `value`: The value of label.
  * `read_time` - The read timeout of a WAF exclusive cluster. Unit: seconds.
  * `resource_group_id` - The ID of the resource group to which the queried domain belongs in Resource Management.
  * `source_ips` - List of the IP address or domain of the origin server to which the specified domain points.
  * `version` - The system data identifier that is used to control optimistic locking.
  * `write_time` - The timeout period for a WAF exclusive cluster write connection. Unit: seconds.
