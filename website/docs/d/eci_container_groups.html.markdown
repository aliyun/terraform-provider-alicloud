# alicloud\_eci\_container\_groups

This data source provides the Eci Container Groups of the current Alibaba Cloud user.

-> **NOTE:** Available in v1.111.0+.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terraform
data "alicloud_eci_container_groups" "example" {
  ids        = ["example_value"]
}

output "first_eci_container_group_id" {
  value = data.alicloud_eci_container_groups.example.groups.0.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `container_group_name` - (Optional, ForceNew) The name of ContainerGroup.
* `enable_details` - (Optional) Default to `false`. Set it to `true` can output more details about resource attributes.
* `ids` - (Optional, ForceNew, Computed) A list of Container Group IDs.
* `limit` - (Optional, ForceNew) The maximum number of resources returned in the response. Default value is `20`. Maximum value: `20`. The number of returned results is no greater than the specified number.
* `name_regex` - (Optional, ForceNew) A regex string to filter results by Container Group name.
* `output_file` - (Optional) File name where to save data source results (after running `terraform plan`).
* `resource_group_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) The ID of the resource group to which the container group belongs. If you have not specified a resource group for the container group, it is added to the default resource group.
* `status` - (Optional, ForceNew) The status list. For more information, see the description of ContainerGroup arrays.
* `vswitch_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) The ID of the VSwitch. Currently, container groups can only be deployed in VPC networks.
