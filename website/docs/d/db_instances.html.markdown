# alicloud\_db\_instances

The `alicloud_db_instances` data source provides a collection of RDS instances available in Alibaba Cloud account.
Filters support regular expression for the instance name, searches by tags, and other filters which are listed below.

## Example Usage

```
data "alicloud_db_instances" "db_instances_ds" {
  name_regex = "data-\\d+"
  status     = "Running"
  tags       = {
    "type" = "database",
    "size" = "tiny"
  }

}

output "first_db_instance_id" {
  value = "${data.alicloud_db_instances.db_instances_ds.instances.0.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name_regex` - (Optional) A regex string to filter results by instance name.
* `ids` - (Optional, Available 1.52.0+) A list of RDS instance IDs. 
* `engine` - (Optional) Database type. Options are `MySQL`, `SQLServer`, `PostgreSQL` and `PPAS`. If no value is specified, all types are returned.
* `status` - (Optional) Status of the instance.
* `db_type` - (Optional) `Primary` for primary instance, `Readonly` for read-only instance, `Guard` for disaster recovery instance, and `Temp` for temporary instance.
* `vpc_id` - (Optional) Used to retrieve instances belong to specified VPC.
* `vswitch_id` - (Optional) Used to retrieve instances belong to specified `vswitch` resources.
* `connection_mode` - (Optional) `Standard` for standard access mode and `Safe` for high security access mode.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags assigned to the DB instances. 
Note: Before 1.60.0, the value's format is a `json` string which including `TagKey` and `TagValue`. `TagKey` cannot be null, and `TagValue` can be empty. Format example `"{\"key1\":\"value1\"}"`
* `output_file` - (Optional) File name where to save data source results (after running `terraform plan`).

  * `availability_zone` - Availability zone.
  * `master_instance_id` - ID of the primary instance. If this parameter is not returned, the current instance is a primary instance.
  * `guard_instance_id` - If a disaster recovery instance is attached to the current instance, the ID of the disaster recovery instance applies.
  * `temp_instance_id` - If a temporary instance is attached to the current instance, the ID of the temporary instance applies.
  * `readonly_instance_ids` - A list of IDs of read-only instances attached to the primary instance.
