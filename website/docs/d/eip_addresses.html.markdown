data "alicloud_eip_addresses" "example" {
  ids        = ["eip-bp1jvx5ki6c********"]
  name_regex = "the_resource_name"
}

output "first_eip_address_id" {
  value = data.alicloud_eip_addresses.example.addresses.0.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `associated_instance_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) The associated instance id.
* `associated_instance_type` - (Optional, ForceNew) The associated instance type.
* `dry_run` - (Optional, ForceNew) The dry run.
* `ip_address` - (Optional, ForceNew) The eip address.
* `address_name` - (Optional, ForceNew) The eip name.
* `enable_details` - (Optional) Default to `true`. Set it to `false` can hide the `tags` to output.
* `ids` - (Optional, ForceNew, Computed)  A list of Address IDs.
* `include_reservation_data` - (Optional, ForceNew) The include reservation data. Valid values: `BGP` and `BGP_PRO`. 
* `isp` - (Optional, ForceNew) The Internet service provider (ISP). Valid values `BGP` and `BGP_PRO`.

* `resource_group_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) The ID of the resource group.
* `segment_instance_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) The IDs of the contiguous EIPs.  This value is returned only when contiguous EIPs are specified.
* `status` - (Optional, ForceNew) The status of the EIP. Valid values:  `Associating`: The EIP is being associated. `Unassociating`: The EIP is being disassociated. `InUse`: The EIP is allocated. `Available`:The EIP is available.
