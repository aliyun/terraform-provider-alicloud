# alicloud\_kms\_key

A kms key can help user to protect data security in the transmission process. For information about Alikms Key and how to use it, see [What is Resource Alikms Key](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28947.htm).

-> **NOTE:** Available in v1.85.0+.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```
resource "alicloud_kms_key" "key" {
  description             = "Hello KMS"
  pending_window_in_days  = "7"
  status                  = "Enabled"
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Optional) The description of the CMK. The description can be 0 to 8,192 characters in length.
* `key_usage` - (Optional, ForceNew) The usage of the CMK. Valid values:
  - ENCRYPT/DECRYPT(default value): encrypts or decrypts data. 
  - SIGN/VERIFY: generates or verifies a digital signature.
* `deletion_window_in_days` - (Optional) Field `deletion_window_in_days` has been deprecated from provider version 1.85.0. New field `pending_window_in_days` instead.
* `is_enabled` - (Optional) Field `is_enabled` has been deprecated from provider version 1.85.0. New field `key_state` instead.
* `automatic_rotation` - (Optional) Specifies whether to enable automatic key rotation. Valid values: 
  - Enabled
  - Disabled (default value)
  **NOTE**: If you set the origin parameter to EXTERNAL or the key_spec parameter to an asymmetric CMK type, automatic key rotation is unavailable.
    
* `key_spec`   - (Optional, ForceNew) The type of the CMK. Valid values: 
  "Aliyun_AES_256", "Aliyun_AES_128", "Aliyun_AES_192", "Aliyun_SM4", "RSA_2048", "RSA_3072", "EC_P256", "EC_P256K", "EC_SM2".
  Note: The default type of the CMK is Aliyun_AES_256. Only Dedicated KMS supports Aliyun_AES_128 and Aliyun_AES_192.
* `key_state` - (Optional) Field `key_state` has been deprecated from provider version 1.123.1. New field `status` instead.
* `status` - (Optional, Available in 1.123.1+) The status of CMK. Valid Values: 
  - Disabled
  - Enabled (default value)
  - PendingDeletion
  
* `origin` - (Optional, ForceNew, Computed) The source of key material. Valid values: 
  - Aliyun_KMS (default value)
  - EXTERNAL
  **NOTE**: The value of this parameter is case-sensitive. If you set the `key_spec` to an asymmetric CMK type, 
    you are not allowed to set the `origin` to EXTERNAL. If you set the `origin` to EXTERNAL, you must import key material. 
    For more information, see [import key material](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/68523.htm).
    
* `pending_window_in_days` - (Optional) The number of days before the CMK is deleted. 
  During this period, the CMK is in the PendingDeletion state. 
  After this period ends, you cannot cancel the deletion. Valid values: 7 to 366. Unit: days.
  **NOTE:** From version 1.184.0, `pending_window_in_days` can be set to `366`.
* `protection_level` - (Optional, ForceNew) The protection level of the CMK. Valid values:
  - SOFTWARE (default value)
  - HSM
  **NOTE**: The value of this parameter is case-sensitive. Assume that you set this parameter to HSM. 
    If you set the origin parameter to Aliyun_KMS, the CMK is created in a managed hardware security module (HSM). 
    If you set the origin parameter to EXTERNA, you can import an external key to the managed HSM.
    
* `rotation_interval` - (Optional) The interval for automatic key rotation. Specify the value in the integer[unit] format.
  The following units are supported: d (day), h (hour), m (minute), and s (second). 
  For example, you can use either 7d or 604800s to specify a seven-day interval. 
  The interval can range from 7 days to 730 days. 
  **NOTE**: It is Required when `automatic_rotation = "Enabled"`
                                           
-> **NOTE:** When the pre-deletion days elapses, the key is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

* `dkms_instance_id` - (Optional, ForceNew, Available in v1.183.0+) The instance ID of the exclusive KMS instance.
