## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```
variable "region" {
  default = "cn-hangzhou"
}
variable "account" {

}

provider "alicloud" {
  account_id = "${var.account}"
  region = "${var.region}"
}

resource "alicloud_fc_service" "foo" {
    name = "my-fc-service"
    description = "created by tf"
    internet_access = false
}

resource "alicloud_fc_function" "foo" {
  service = "${alicloud_fc_service.foo.name}"
  name = "hello-world"
  description = "tf unit test"
  filename = "./hello.zip"
  memory_size = "512"
  runtime = "python2.7"
  handler = "hello.handler"
  environment_variables {
