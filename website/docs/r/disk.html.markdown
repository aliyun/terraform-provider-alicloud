# alicloud\_disk

Provides a ECS disk resource.

-> **NOTE:** One of `size` or `snapshot_id` is required when specifying an ECS disk. If all of them be specified, `size` must more than the size of snapshot which `snapshot_id` represents. Currently, `alicloud_disk` doesn't resize disk.

## Example Usage

```
# Create a new ECS disk.
resource "alicloud_disk" "ecs_disk" {
  # cn-beijing
  availability_zone = "cn-beijing-b"
  name              = "New-disk"
  description       = "Hello ecs disk."
  category          = "cloud_efficiency"
  size              = "30"

  tags {
    Name = "TerraformTest"
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_zone` - (Required, ForceNew) The Zone to create the disk in.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of the ECS disk. This name can have a string of 2 to 128 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, such as "-",".","_", and must not begin or end with a hyphen, and must not begin with http:// or https://. Default value is null.

* `size` - (Required) The size of the disk in GiBs. When resize the disk, the new size must be greater than the former value, or you would get an error `InvalidDiskSize.TooSmall`.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) A snapshot to base the disk off of. If the disk size required by snapshot is greater than `size`, the `size` will be ignored.
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) If true, the disk will be encrypted
