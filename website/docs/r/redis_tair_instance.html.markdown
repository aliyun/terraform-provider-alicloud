### Deleting `alicloud_redis_tair_instance` or removing it from your configuration

The `alicloud_redis_tair_instance` resource allows you to manage  `payment_type = "Subscription"`  instance, but Terraform cannot destroy it.
Deleting the subscription resource or removing it from your configuration will remove it from your state file and management, but will not destroy the Instance.
You can resume managing the subscription instance via the AlibabaCloud Console.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* `auto_renew` - (Optional) Specifies whether to enable auto-renewal for the instance. Default value: false. Valid values: true(enables auto-renewal), false(disables auto-renewal).
* `auto_renew_period` - (Optional) The subscription duration that is supported by auto-renewal. Unit: months. Valid values: 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12. This parameter is required only if the AutoRenew parameter is set to true.
* `backup_id` - (Optional, Available since v1.233.1) You can set the BackupId parameter to the backup set ID of the source instance. The system uses the data stored in the backup set to create an instance. You can call the DescribeBackups operation to query backup set IDs. If the source instance is a cluster instance, set the BackupId parameter to the backup set IDs of all shards of the source instance, separated by commas (,).

  If your instance is a cloud-native cluster instance, we recommend that you use DescribeClusterBackupList to query the backup set ID of the cluster instance. Then, set the ClusterBackupId request parameter to the backup set ID to clone the cluster instance. This eliminates the need to specify the backup set ID of each shard.
* `cluster_backup_id` - (Optional, Available since v1.224.0) This parameter is supported for specific new cluster instances. You can query the backup set ID by calling the DescribeClusterBackupList operation. If this parameter is supported, you can specify the backup set ID. In this case, you do not need to specify the BackupId parameter. If this parameter is not supported, set the BackupId parameter to the IDs of backup sets in all shards of the source instance, separated by commas (,).
* `connection_string_prefix` - (Optional, Available since v1.235.0) The prefix of the endpoint the instance, which must consist of lowercase letters and numbers and start with a lowercase letter.
* `effective_time` - (Optional) The time when to change the configurations. Default value: Immediately. Valid values: Immediately (The configurations are immediately changed), MaintainTime (The configurations are changed within the maintenance window).
* `engine_version` - (Optional, Computed) Database version. Default value: 1.0.

  Rules for transferring parameters of different tair product types:

  tair_scm: The Tair persistent memory is compatible with the Redis6.0 protocol and is passed 1.0.

  tair_essd: The disk (ESSD/SSD) is compatible with the Redis4.0 and Redis6.0 protocols, and is transmitted to 1.0 and 2.0 respectively.
* `force_upgrade` - (Optional) Specifies whether to forcefully change the configurations of the instance. Default value: true. Valid values: false (The system does not forcefully change the configurations), true (The system forcefully changes the configurations).
