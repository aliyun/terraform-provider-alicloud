# alicloud\_db\_account

Provides an RDS account resource and used to manage databases.

-> **NOTE:** Currently, only MySQL、MariaDB、SQL Server（exclude SQL Server 2017 clustered edition）instance support creating a `Normal` account. Other engine instance, like PostgreSQL, PPAS and SQL Server 2017, only support creating a `Super` account, and you can log on to the database to create other accounts using this Super account.
> **NOTE:** Because the `Super` account can not be deleted, there does not suggest to manage `Super` account using this resource. Otherwise, this resource can not be deleted when account is `Super`.

## Example Usage

```
    variable "creation" {
    		default = "Rds"
    }
    
    variable "name" {
    		default = "dbaccountmysql"
    }

    data "alicloud_zones" "default" {
        available_resource_creation = "${var.creation}"
    }

    resource "alicloud_vpc" "default" {
        name       = "${var.name}"
        cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/16"
    }

    resource "alicloud_vswitch" "default" {
        vpc_id            = "${alicloud_vpc.default.id}"
        cidr_block        = "172.16.0.0/24"
        availability_zone = "${data.alicloud_zones.default.zones.0.id}"
        name              = "${var.name}"
    }
    
	resource "alicloud_db_instance" "instance" {
		engine = "MySQL"
		engine_version = "5.6"
		instance_type = "rds.mysql.s1.small"
		instance_storage = "10"
		vswitch_id = "${alicloud_vswitch.default.id}"
	    instance_name = "${var.name}"
	}

	resource "alicloud_db_account" "account" {
	  	instance_id = "${alicloud_db_instance.instance.id}"
	  	name = "tftestnormal"
	  	password = "Test12345"
	}
```
