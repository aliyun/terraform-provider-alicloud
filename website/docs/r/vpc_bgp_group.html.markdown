}

variable "name" {
  default = "tf-example"
}
data "alicloud_express_connect_physical_connections" "example" {
  name_regex = "^preserved-NODELETING"
}
resource "random_integer" "vlan_id" {
  max = 2999
  min = 1
}
resource "alicloud_express_connect_virtual_border_router" "example" {
  local_gateway_ip           = "10.0.0.1"

  peering_subnet_mask        = "255.255.255.252"
  physical_connection_id     = data.alicloud_express_connect_physical_connections.example.connections.0.id
  virtual_border_router_name = var.name
  vlan_id                    = random_integer.vlan_id.id
  min_rx_interval            = 1000
  min_tx_interval            = 1000
  detect_multiplier          = 10

  auth_key       = "YourPassword+12345678"
  bgp_group_name = var.name
  description    = var.name
  peer_asn       = 1111
