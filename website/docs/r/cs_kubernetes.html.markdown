# alicloud_cs_kubernetes

This resource will help you to manage a Kubernetes Cluster in Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes Service, see [What is kubernetes](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ack/ack-managed-and-ack-dedicated/developer-reference/create-an-ask-cluster-1).

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.9.0.

-> **NOTE:** Kubernetes cluster only supports VPC network and it can access internet while creating kubernetes cluster.
A Nat Gateway and configuring a SNAT for it can ensure one VPC network access internet. If there is no nat gateway in the
VPC, you can set `new_nat_gateway` to "true" to create one automatically.

-> **NOTE:** Each kubernetes cluster contains 3 master nodes and those number cannot be changed at now.

-> **NOTE:** Creating kubernetes cluster need to install several packages and it will cost about 15 minutes. Please be patient.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.9.4, the provider supports to download kube config, client certificate, client key and cluster ca certificate
after creating cluster successfully, and you can put them into the specified location, like '~/.kube/config'.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.16.0, the provider supports Multiple Availability Zones Kubernetes Cluster. To create a cluster of this kind, you must specify 3 or 5 items in `master_vswitch_ids` and `master_instance_types`.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.20.0, the provider supports disabling internet load balancer for API Server by setting `false` to `slb_internet_enabled`.

-> **NOTE:** If you want to manage Kubernetes, you can use [Kubernetes Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/index.html).

-> **NOTE:** You need to activate several other products and confirm Authorization Policy used by Container Service before using this resource.
Please refer to the `Authorization management` and `Cluster management` sections in the [Document Center](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/86488.htm).

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.75.0, Some parameters have been removed from resource,You can check them below and re-import the cluster if necessary.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.101.0+, We supported the `professional managed clusters(ack-pro)`, You can create a pro cluster by setting the the value of `cluster_spec`.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.177.0+, `exclude_autoscaler_nodes`,`worker_number`,`worker_vswitch_ids`,`worker_instance_types`,`worker_instance_charge_type`,`worker_period`,`worker_period_unit`,`worker_auto_renew`,`worker_auto_renew_period`,`worker_disk_category`,`worker_disk_size`,`worker_data_disks`,`node_port_range`,`cpu_policy`,`user_data`,`taints`,`worker_disk_performance_level`,`worker_disk_snapshot_policy_id` are deprecated.
We Suggest you using resource **`alicloud_cs_kubernetes_node_pool`** to manage your cluster worker nodes.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.212.0, `exclude_autoscaler_nodes`,`worker_number`,`worker_vswitch_ids`,`worker_instance_types`,`worker_instance_charge_type`,`worker_period`,`worker_period_unit`,`worker_auto_renew`,`worker_auto_renew_period`,`worker_disk_category`,`worker_disk_size`,`worker_data_disks`,`node_port_range`,`cpu_policy`,`user_data`,`taints`,`worker_disk_performance_level`,`worker_disk_snapshot_policy_id`,`kube_config`,`availability_zone` are removed.
Please use resource **`alicloud_cs_kubernetes_node_pool`** to manage your cluster worker nodes.
