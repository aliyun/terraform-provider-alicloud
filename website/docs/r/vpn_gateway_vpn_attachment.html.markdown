# alicloud_vpn_gateway_vpn_attachment

Provides a VPN Gateway Vpn Attachment resource.

VpnAttachment has been upgraded to dual-tunnel mode. When you create a VpnAttachment in dual tunnel mode, you can configure the following request parameters in addition to the required parameters: vpn_attachment_name, network_type, effectImmediately, tags array, resource_group_id, tunnel_options_specification array, and enable_tunnels_bgp.

For information about VPN Gateway Vpn Attachment and how to use it, see [What is Vpn Attachment](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/virtual-private-cloud/latest/createvpnattachment).

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.181.0.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* `bgp_config` - (Optional, Computed, List) Bgp configuration information.
  - This parameter is supported when you create an vpn attachment in single-tunnel mode. See [`bgp_config`](#bgp_config) below.
* `customer_gateway_id` - (Optional, Available since v1.196.0) Customer gateway ID.
  - This parameter is required when creating a single-tunnel mode vpn attachment.
* `effect_immediately` - (Optional, Computed) Specifies whether to immediately start IPsec negotiations after the configuration takes effect. Valid values:
  - `true`: immediately starts IPsec negotiations after the configuration is complete.
  - `false` (default): starts IPsec negotiations when inbound traffic is received.
* `enable_dpd` - (Optional, Computed) This parameter is supported if you create an vpn attachment in single-tunnel mode.
Whether to enable the DPD (peer survival detection) function.
  - true (default): enables DPD. The initiator of the IPsec-VPN connection sends DPD packets to check the existence and availability of the peer. If no feedback is received from the peer within the specified period of time, the connection fails. In this case, ISAKMP SA and IPsec SA are deleted along with the security tunnel.
  - false: disables DPD. The initiator of the IPsec-VPN connection does not send DPD packets.
* `enable_nat_traversal` - (Optional, Computed) This parameter is supported if you create an vpn attachment in single-tunnel mode.
Specifies whether to enable NAT traversal. Valid values:
  - true (default): enables NAT traversal. After NAT traversal is enabled, the initiator does not check the UDP ports during IKE negotiations and can automatically discover NAT gateway devices along the vpn attachment tunnel.
  - false: disables NAT traversal.
* `enable_tunnels_bgp` - (Optional, Computed, Available since v1.246.0) You can configure this parameter when you create a vpn attachment in dual-tunnel mode.Whether to enable the BGP function for the tunnel. Value: `true` or `false` (default).
