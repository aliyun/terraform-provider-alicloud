  Provides a Alicloud resource to manage container serverless kubernetes cluster.

# alicloud_cs_serverless_kubernetes

This resource will help you to manager a Serverless Kubernetes Cluster, see [What is serverless kubernetes](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ack/ack-managed-and-ack-dedicated/developer-reference/create-a-dedicated-kubernetes-cluster-that-supports-sandboxed-containers). The cluster is same as container service created by web console.

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.58.0.

-> **NOTE:** Serverless Kubernetes cluster only supports VPC network and it can access internet while creating kubernetes cluster.
A Nat Gateway and configuring a SNAT for it can ensure one VPC network access internet. If there is no nat gateway in the
VPC, you can set `new_nat_gateway` to "true" to create one automatically.

-> **NOTE:** Creating serverless kubernetes cluster need to install several packages and it will cost about 5 minutes. Please be patient.

-> **NOTE:** The provider supports to download kube config, client certificate, client key and cluster ca certificate
after creating cluster successfully, and you can put them into the specified location, like '~/.kube/config'.

-> **NOTE:** If you want to manage serverless Kubernetes, you can use [Kubernetes Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/index.html).

-> **NOTE:** You need to activate several other products and confirm Authorization Policy used by Container Service before using this resource.
Please refer to the `Authorization management` and `Cluster management` sections in the [Document Center](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/86488.htm).

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.162.0, support for creating professional serverless cluster.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.230.0, support to migrate basic serverless cluster to professional serverless cluster.

## Import

Serverless Kubernetes cluster can be imported using the id, e.g. Then complete the main.tf accords to the result of `terraform plan`.

```shell
$ terraform import alicloud_cs_serverless_kubernetes.main ce4273f9156874b46bb
