# alicloud\_image\_export

Export a custom image to the OSS bucket in the same region as the custom image.

-> **NOTE:** If you create an ECS instance using a mirror image and create a system disk snapshot again, exporting a custom image created from the system disk snapshot is not supported.

-> **NOTE:** Support for exporting custom images that include data disk snapshot information in the image. The number of data disks cannot exceed 4 and the maximum capacity of a single data disk cannot exceed 500 GiB.

-> **NOTE:** Before exporting the image, you must authorize the cloud server ECS official service account to write OSS permissions through RAM.

-> **NOTE:** Available in 1.68.0+.
