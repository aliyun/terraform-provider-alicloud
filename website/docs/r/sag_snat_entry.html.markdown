# alicloud\_sag\_snat_entry

Provides a Sag SnatEntry resource. This topic describes how to add a SNAT entry to enable the SNAT function. The SNAT function can hide internal IP addresses and resolve private IP address conflicts. With this function, on-premises sites can access internal IP addresses, but cannot be accessed by internal IP addresses. If you do not add a SNAT entry, on-premises sites can access each other only when all related IP addresses do not conflict.
