This parameter currently only supports China stations, and only supports mainland mobile phone numbers, and up to 10 mobile phone numbers can be passed in.
* `delay_rule_time` - (Optional, ForceNew) The delay rule time. When `delay_notice` is set to `true`, this parameter must be passed in. The threshold for triggering the delay alarm. The unit is second and needs to be an integer. The threshold can be set according to business needs.

This parameter currently only supports China stations, and only supports mainland mobile phone numbers, and up to 10 mobile phone numbers can be passed in.
* `status` - (Optional) The status of the resource. Valid values: `Synchronizing`, `Suspending`. You can stop the task by specifying `Suspending` and start the task by specifying `Synchronizing`.

-> **NOTE:** From the status of `NotStarted` to `Synchronizing`, the resource goes through the `Prechecking` and `Initializing` phases. Because of the `Initializing` phase takes too long, and once the resource passes to the status of `Prechecking`, it can be considered that the task can be executed normally. Therefore, we treat the status of `Initializing` as an equivalent to `Synchronizing`.

-> **NOTE:** If you want to upgrade the synchronization job specifications by the property `instance_class`, you must also modify the property `instance_class` of it's instance to keep them consistent.

## Notice

1. The expiration time cannot be changed after the work of the annual and monthly subscription suspended;
2. After the pay-as-you-go type job suspended, your job configuration fee will still be charged;
3. If the task suspended for more than 6 hours, the task will not start successfully.
4. Suspending the task will only stop writing to the target library, but will still continue to obtain the incremental log of the source, so that the task can be quickly resumed after the suspension is canceled. Therefore, some resources of the source library, such as bandwidth resources, will continue to be occupied during the period.
5. Charges will continue during the task suspension period. If you need to stop charging, please release the instance
6. When a DTS instance suspended for more than 7 days, the instance cannot be resumed, and the status will change from suspended to failed.
