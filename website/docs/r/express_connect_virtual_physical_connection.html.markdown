# alicloud_express_connect_virtual_physical_connection

Provides a Express Connect Virtual Physical Connection resource.

For information about Express Connect Virtual Physical Connection and how to use it, see [What is Virtual Physical Connection](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/express-connect/latest/createvirtualphysicalconnection#doc-api-Vpc-CreateVirtualPhysicalConnection).

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.196.0.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terraform
provider "alicloud" {
  region = "cn-hangzhou"
}
variable "name" {
  default = "tf-example"
}
data "alicloud_express_connect_physical_connections" "example" {
  name_regex = "^preserved-NODELETING"
}
resource "random_integer" "vlan_id" {
  max = 2999
  min = 1
}
data "alicloud_account" "default" {}
resource "alicloud_express_connect_virtual_physical_connection" "example" {
  virtual_physical_connection_name = var.name
  description                      = var.name
  order_mode                       = "PayByPhysicalConnectionOwner"
  parent_physical_connection_id    = data.alicloud_express_connect_physical_connections.example.ids.0
  spec                             = "50M"
  vlan_id                          = random_integer.vlan_id.id
  vpconn_ali_uid                   = data.alicloud_account.default.id
}
```
