# alicloud_vpn_gateway

Provides a VPN gateway resource.

-> **NOTE:** Terraform will auto build vpn instance  while it uses `alicloud_vpn_gateway` to build a vpn resource.

-> Currently International-Site account can open `PostPaid` VPN gateway and China-Site account can open `PrePaid` VPN gateway.

For information about VPN gateway and how to use it, see [What is VPN gateway](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/120365.html).

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.13.0.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

[IPsec-VPN connections support the dual-tunnel mode](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/vpn/product-overview/ipsec-vpn-connections-support-the-dual-tunnel-mode)

```terraform
variable "name" {
  default = "terraform-example"
}

variable "spec" {
  default = "20"
}

data "alicloud_zones" "default" {
  available_resource_creation = "VSwitch"
}

data "alicloud_vpcs" "default" {
  name_regex = "^default-NODELETING$"
  cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/16"
}

data "alicloud_vswitches" "default0" {
  vpc_id  = data.alicloud_vpcs.default.ids.0
  zone_id = data.alicloud_zones.default.ids.0
}

data "alicloud_vswitches" "default1" {
  vpc_id  = data.alicloud_vpcs.default.ids.0
  zone_id = data.alicloud_zones.default.ids.1
}

resource "alicloud_vpn_gateway" "default" {
  vpn_type         = "Normal"
  vpn_gateway_name = var.name

  vswitch_id                   = data.alicloud_vswitches.default0.ids.0
  disaster_recovery_vswitch_id = data.alicloud_vswitches.default1.ids.0
  auto_pay                     = true
  vpc_id                       = data.alicloud_vpcs.default.ids.0
  network_type                 = "public"
  payment_type                 = "Subscription"
  enable_ipsec                 = true
  bandwidth                    = var.spec
}
```

### Deleting `alicloud_vpn_gateway` or removing it from your configuration

The `alicloud_vpn_gateway` resource allows you to manage  `payment_type = "Subscription"`  instance, but Terraform cannot destroy it.
Deleting the subscription resource or removing it from your configuration will remove it from your state file and management, but will not destroy the Instance.
You can resume managing the subscription instance via the AlibabaCloud Console.
