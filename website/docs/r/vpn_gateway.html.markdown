# alicloud\_vpn_gateway

Provides a VPN gateway resource.

-> **NOTE:** Terraform will auto build vpn instance  while it uses `alicloud_vpn_gateway` to build a vpn resource.

-> Currently International-Site account can open `PostPaid` VPN gateway and China-Site account can open `PrePaid` VPN gateway.

For information about VPN gateway and how to use it, see [What is VPN gateway](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/120365.html).

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```
resource "alicloud_vpc" "vpc" {
  name       = "tf_test_foo"
  cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/12"
}

resource "alicloud_vswitch" "vsw" {
  vpc_id            = alicloud_vpc.vpc.id
  cidr_block        = "172.16.0.0/21"
  availability_zone = "cn-beijing-b"
}

resource "alicloud_vpn_gateway" "foo" {
  name                 = "vpnGatewayConfig"
  vpc_id               = alicloud_vpc.vpc.id
  bandwidth            = "10"
  enable_ssl           = true
  instance_charge_type = "PostPaid"
  description          = "test_create_description"
  vswitch_id           = alicloud_vswitch.vsw.id
}
```

### Deleting `alicloud_vpn_gateway` or removing it from your configuration

The `alicloud_vpn_gateway` resource allows you to manage `instance_charge_type = "Prepaid"` vpn gateway, but Terraform cannot destroy it.
Deleting the subscription resource or removing it from your configuration
will remove it from your state file and management, but will not destroy the VPN Gateway.
You can resume managing the subscription vpn gateway via the AlibabaCloud Console.
