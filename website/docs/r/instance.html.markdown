# alicloud\_instance

Provides a ECS instance resource.

-> **NOTE:** You can launch an ECS instance for a VPC network via specifying parameter `vswitch_id`. One instance can only belong to one VSwitch.

-> **NOTE:** If a VSwitchId is specified for creating an instance, SecurityGroupId and VSwitchId must belong to one VPC.

-> **NOTE:** Several instance types have outdated in some regions and availability zones, such as `ecs.t1.*`, `ecs.s2.*`, `ecs.n1.*` and so on. If you want to keep them, you should set `is_outdated` to true. For more about the upgraded instance type, refer to `alicloud_instance_types` datasource.

-> **NOTE:** At present, 'PrePaid' instance cannot be deleted and must wait it to be outdated and release it automatically.

-> **NOTE:** The resource supports modifying instance charge type from 'PrePaid' to 'PostPaid' from version 1.9.6.
 However, at present, this modification has some limitation about CPU core count in one month, so strongly recommand that `Don't modify instance charge type frequentlly in one month`.

-> **NOTE:**  There is unsupported 'deletion_protection' attribute when the instance is spot

## Example Usage

```
# Create a new ECS instance for a VPC
resource "alicloud_security_group" "group" {
  name        = "tf_test_foo"
  description = "foo"
  vpc_id      = "${alicloud_vpc.vpc.id}"
}

resource "alicloud_instance" "instance" {
  # cn-beijing
  availability_zone = "cn-beijing-b"
  security_groups   = "${alicloud_security_group.group.*.id}"

  # series III
  instance_type              = "ecs.n4.large"
  system_disk_category       = "cloud_efficiency"
  image_id                   = "ubuntu_18_04_64_20G_alibase_20190624.vhd"
  instance_name              = "test_foo"
  vswitch_id                 = "${alicloud_vswitch.vswitch.id}"
  internet_max_bandwidth_out = 10
}

# Create a new ECS instance for VPC
resource "alicloud_vpc" "vpc" {
  # Other parameters...
}

resource "alicloud_vswitch" "vswitch" {
  vpc_id = "${alicloud_vpc.vpc.id}"
  # Other parameters...
}

resource "alicloud_slb" "slb" {
  name       = "test-slb-tf"
  vpc_id     = "${alicloud_vpc.vpc.id}"
  vswitch_id = "${alicloud_vswitch.vswitch.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

-> **NOTE:** System disk category `cloud` has been outdated and it only can be used none I/O Optimized ECS instances. Recommend `cloud_efficiency` and `cloud_ssd` disk.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.5.0, instance's charge type can be changed to "PrePaid" by specifying `period` and `period_unit`, but it is irreversible.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.5.0, instance's private IP address can be specified when creating VPC network instance.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.5.0, instance's vswitch and private IP can be changed in the same availability zone. When they are changed, the instance will reboot to make the change take effect.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.7.0, setting "internet_max_bandwidth_out" larger than 0 can allocate a public IP for an instance.
 Setting "internet_max_bandwidth_out" to 0 can release allocated public IP for VPC instance(For Classic instnace, its public IP cannot be release once it allocated, even thougth its bandwidth out is 0).
 However, at present, 'PrePaid' instance cannot narrow its max bandwidth out when its 'internet_charge_type' is "PayByBandwidth".

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.7.0, instance's type can be changed. When it is changed, the instance will reboot to make the change take effect.

### Timeouts

-> **NOTE:** Available in 1.46.0+.

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when creating the instance (until it reaches the initial `Running` status). 
`Note`: There are extra at most 2 minutes used to retry to aviod some needless API errors and it is not in the timeouts configure.
* `update` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when stopping and starting the instance when necessary during update - e.g. when changing instance type, password, image, vswitch and private IP.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 mins) Used when terminating the instance. `Note`: There are extra at most 5 minutes used to retry to aviod some needless API errors and it is not in the timeouts configure.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The instance ID.
* `status` - The instance status.
* `public_ip` - The instance public ip.

## Import

Instance can be imported using the id, e.g.
