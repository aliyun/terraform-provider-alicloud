# alicloud\_instance

Provides a ECS instance resource.

~> **NOTE:** You can launch an ECS instance for a VPC network via specifying parameter `vswitch_id`. One instance can only belong to one VSwitch.

~> **NOTE:** If a VSwitchId is specified for creating an instance, SecurityGroupId and VSwitchId must belong to one VPC.

~> **NOTE:** Several instance types have outdated in some regions and availability zones, such as `ecs.t1.*`, `ecs.s2.*`, `ecs.n1.*` and so on. If you want to keep them, you should set `is_outdated` to true. For more about the upgraded instance type, refer to `alicloud_instance_types` datasource.

~> **NOTE:** At present, 'PrePaid' instance cannot be deleted and must wait it to be outdated and release it automatically.

~> **NOTE:** The resource supports modifying instance charge type from 'PrePaid' to 'PostPaid' from version 1.9.6.
 However, at present, this modification has some limitation about CPU core count in one month, so strongly recommand that `Don't modify instance charge type frequentlly in one month`.

## Example Usage

```
# Create a new ECS instance for a VPC
resource "alicloud_security_group" "group" {
  name        = "tf_test_foo"
  description = "foo"
  vpc_id = "${alicloud_vpc.vpc.id}"
}

resource "alicloud_instance" "instance" {
  # cn-beijing
  availability_zone = "cn-beijing-b"
  security_groups = ["${alicloud_security_group.group.*.id}"]

  # series III
  instance_type        = "ecs.n4.large"
  system_disk_category = "cloud_efficiency"
  image_id             = "ubuntu_140405_64_40G_cloudinit_20161115.vhd"
  instance_name        = "test_foo"
  vswitch_id = "${alicloud_vswitch.vswitch.id}"
  internet_max_bandwidth_out = 10
}

# Create a new ECS instance for VPC
resource "alicloud_vpc" "vpc" {
  # Other parameters...
}

resource "alicloud_vswitch" "vswitch" {
  vpc_id = "${alicloud_vpc.vpc.id}"
  # Other parameters...
}

resource "alicloud_slb" "slb" {
  name       = "test-slb-tf"
  vpc_id     = "${alicloud_vpc.vpc.id}"
  vswitch_id = "${alicloud_vswitch.vswitch.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `image_id` - (Required) The Image to use for the instance. ECS instance's image can be replaced via changing 'image_id'. When it is changed, the instance will reboot to make the change take effect.
* `instance_type` - (Required) The type of instance to start.
* `io_optimized` - (Deprecated) It has been deprecated on instance resource. All the launched alicloud instances will be I/O optimized.
* `is_outdated` - (Optional) Whether to use outdated instance type. Default to false.
* `security_groups` - (Required)  A list of security group ids to associate with.
* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The Zone to start the instance in. It is ignored and will be computed when set `vswitch_id`.

On Windows, the host name can contain a maximum of 15 characters, which can be a combination of uppercase/lowercase letters, numerals, and “-“. The host name cannot contain dots (“.”) or contain only numeric characters.
On other OSs such as Linux, the host name can contain a maximum of 30 characters, which can be segments separated by dots (“.”), where each segment can contain uppercase/lowercase letters, numerals, or “_“. When it is changed, the instance will reboot to make the change take effect.
* `password` - (Optional) Password to an instance is a string of 8 to 30 characters. It must contain uppercase/lowercase letters and numerals, but cannot contain special symbols. When it is changed, the instance will reboot to make the change take effect.
* `vswitch_id` - (Optional) The virtual switch ID to launch in VPC. If you want to create instances in VPC network, this parameter must be set.
* `instance_charge_type` - (Optional) Valid values are `PrePaid`, `PostPaid`, The default is `PostPaid`.
* `period_unit` - (Optional) The duration unit that you will buy the resource. It is valid when `instance_charge_type` is 'PrePaid'. Valid value: ["Week", "Month"]. Default to "Month".
* `period` - (Optional) The duration that you will buy the resource, in month. It is valid when `instance_charge_type` is `PrePaid`. Default to 1. Valid values:

    - SpotAsPriceGo: A price that is based on the highest Pay-As-You-Go instance

    Default to NoSpot.
* `spot_price_limit` - (Optional, Float, Force New) The hourly price threshold of a instance, and it takes effect only when parameter 'spot_strategy' is 'SpotWithPriceLimit'. Three decimals is allowed at most.
* `force_delete` - (Optional, Available 1.18.0+) If it is true, the "PrePaid" instance will be change to "PostPaid" and then deleted forcibly.
However, because of changing instance charge type has CPU core count quota limitation, so strongly recommand that "Don't modify instance charge type frequentlly in one month".

~> **NOTE:** System disk category `cloud` has been outdated and it only can be used none I/O Optimized ECS instances. Recommend `cloud_efficiency` and `cloud_ssd` disk.

~> **NOTE:** From version 1.5.0, instance's charge type can be changed to "PrePaid" by specifying `period` and `period_unit`, but it is irreversible.

~> **NOTE:** From version 1.5.0, instance's private IP address can be specified when creating VPC network instance.

~> **NOTE:** From version 1.5.0, instance's vswitch and private IP can be changed in the same availability zone. When they are changed, the instance will reboot to make the change take effect.

~> **NOTE:** From version 1.7.0, setting "internet_max_bandwidth_out" larger than 0 can allocate a public IP for an instance.
 Setting "internet_max_bandwidth_out" to 0 can release allocated public IP for VPC instance(For Classic instnace, its public IP cannot be release once it allocated, even thougth its bandwidth out is 0).
 However, at present, 'PrePaid' instance cannot narrow its max bandwidth out when its 'internet_charge_type' is "PayByBandwidth".

~> **NOTE:** From version 1.7.0, instance's type can be changed. When it is changed, the instance will reboot to make the change take effect.
