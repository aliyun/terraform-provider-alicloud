# alicloud_eip_address

Provides a EIP Address resource.

-> **NOTE:** BGP (Multi-ISP) lines are supported in all regions. BGP (Multi-ISP) Pro lines are supported only in the China (Hong Kong) region.

-> **NOTE:** The resource only supports to create `PayAsYouGo PayByTraffic`  or `Subscription PayByBandwidth` elastic IP for international account. Otherwise, you will happened error `COMMODITY.INVALID_COMPONENT`.
Your account is international if you can use it to login in [International Web Console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm).

For information about EIP Address and how to use it, see [What is Address](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/36016.htm).

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.126.0.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terraform
variable "name" {
  default = "terraform-example"
}


resource "alicloud_eip_address" "default" {
  description               = var.name
  isp                       = "BGP"
  address_name              = var.name
  netmode                   = "public"
  bandwidth                 = "1"
  security_protection_types = ["AntiDDoS_Enhanced"]
  payment_type              = "PayAsYouGo"
}
```

### Deleting `alicloud_eip_address` or removing it from your configuration

The `alicloud_eip_address` resource allows you to manage  `payment_type = "Subscription"`  instance, but Terraform cannot destroy it.
Deleting the subscription resource or removing it from your configuration will remove it from your state file and management, but will not destroy the Instance.
You can resume managing the subscription instance via the AlibabaCloud Console.
