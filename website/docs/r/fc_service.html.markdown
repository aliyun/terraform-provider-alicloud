# alicloud\_fc\_service

Provides a Alicloud Function Compute Service resource. The resource is the base of launching Function and Trigger configuration.
 For information about Service and how to use it, see [What is Function Compute](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/52895.htm).

-> **NOTE:** The resource requires a provider field 'account_id'. [See account_id](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/index.html#account_id).

-> **NOTE:** If you happen the error "Argument 'internetAccess' is not supported", you need to log on web console and click button "Apply VPC Function"
which is in the upper of [Function Service Web Console](https://fc.console.aliyun.com/) page.

-> **NOTE:** Currently not all regions support Function Compute Service.
For more details supported regions, see [Service endpoints](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/52984.htm)

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terrraform
variable "name" {
  default = "tf-testaccalicloudfcservice"
}

resource "alicloud_log_project" "foo" {
  name = var.name
}

resource "alicloud_log_store" "foo" {
  project = alicloud_log_project.foo.name
  name    = var.name
}

resource "alicloud_ram_role" "role" {
  name     = var.name
  document = <<EOF
  {
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": [
              "fc.aliyuncs.com"
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
      "Version": "1"
  }
  EOF
  description = "this is a test"
  force       = true
}

resource "alicloud_ram_role_policy_attachment" "attac" {
  role_name   = alicloud_ram_role.role.name
  policy_name = "AliyunLogFullAccess"
  policy_type = "System"
}

resource "alicloud_fc_service" "foo" {
  name        = var.name
  description = "tf unit test"
  role        = alicloud_ram_role.role.arn
  depends_on  = [alicloud_ram_role_policy_attachment.attac]
}
```

## Module Support

You can use to the existing [fc module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-alicloud-modules/fc/alicloud) 
to create a service and a function quickly and then set several triggers for it.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (ForceNew) The Function Compute Service name. It is the only in one Alicloud account and is conflict with `name_prefix`.
* `name_prefix` - (ForceNew) Setting a prefix to get a only name. It is conflict with `name`.
* `description` - (Optional) The Function Compute Service description.
* `internet_access` - (Optional) Whether to allow the Service to access Internet. Default to "true".
* `role` - (Optional) RAM role arn attached to the Function Compute Service. This governs both who / what can invoke your Function, as well as what resources our Function has access to. See [User Permissions](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/52885.htm) for more details.
* `log_config` - (Optional) Provide this to store your Function Compute Service logs. Fields documented below. See [Create a Service](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/51924.htm).
* `vpc_config` - (Optional) Provide this to allow your Function Compute Service to access your VPC. Fields documented below. See [Function Compute Service in VPC](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/faq-detail/72959.htm).
* `nas_config` - (Optional, available in 1.96.0+) Provide [NAS configuration](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/87401.htm) to allow Function Compute Service to access your NAS resources.
* `publish` - (Optional, available in 1.101.0+) Whether to publish creation/change as new Function Compute Service Version. Defaults to `false`.

**log_config** requires the following:

* `project` - (Required) The project name of the Alicloud Simple Log Service.
* `logstore` - (Required) The log store name of Alicloud Simple Log Service.

-> **NOTE:** If both `project` and `logstore` are empty, log_config is considered to be empty or unset.

**vpc_config** requires the following:

* `vswitch_ids` - (Required) A list of vswitch IDs associated with the Function Compute Service.
* `security_group_id` - (Required) A security group ID associated with the Function Compute Service.

-> **NOTE:** If both `vswitch_ids` and `security_group_id` are empty, vpc_config is considered to be empty or unset.

**nas_config** requires the following:

* `user_id` - (Required) The user id of your NAS file system.
* `group_id` - (Required) The group id of your NAS file system.
* `mount_points` - (Required) Config the NAS mount points, including following attributes:
  * `server_addr` - (Required) The address of the remote NAS directory.
  * `mount_dir` - (Required) The local address where to mount your remote NAS directory.

## Attributes Reference

The following arguments are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the FC Service. The value is the same as name.
* `service_id` - The Function Compute Service ID.
* `last_modified` - The date this resource was last modified.
* `version` - The latest published version of your Function Compute Service.

## Import

Function Compute Service can be imported using the id or name, e.g.

```
$ terraform import alicloud_fc_service.foo my-fc-service
```
