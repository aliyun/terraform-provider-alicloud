  name    = "tf-testAccCmsAlarm_basic"
  project = "acs_ecs_dashboard"
  metric  = "disk_writebytes"
  dimensions = {
    instanceId = "i-bp1247,i-bp11gd"
    device     = "/dev/vda1,/dev/vdb1"
  }
  statistics      = "Average"
  period          = 900
  operator        = "<="
  threshold       = 35
  triggered_count = 2
  contact_groups  = ["test-group"]
