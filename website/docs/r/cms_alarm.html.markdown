# alicloud\_cms\_alarm

This resource provides a alarm rule resource and it can be used to monitor several cloud services according different metrics.
Details for [alarm rule](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28608.htm).

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```
resource "alicloud_cms_alarm" "basic" {
  name    = "tf-testAccCmsAlarm_basic"
  project = "acs_ecs_dashboard"
  metric  = "disk_writebytes"
  dimensions = {
    instanceId = "i-bp1247,i-bp11gd"
    device     = "/dev/vda1,/dev/vdb1"
  }
  statistics         = "Average"
  period             = 900
  operator           = "<="
  threshold          = 35
  triggered_count    = 2
  contact_groups     = ["test-group"]
  effective_interval = "0:00-2:00"
  notify_type        = 1
  webhook            = "https://${data.alicloud_account.current.id}.eu-central-1.fc.aliyuncs.com/2016-08-15/proxy/Terraform/AlarmEndpointMock/"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The alarm rule name.
* `project` - (Required, ForceNew) Monitor project name, such as "acs_ecs_dashboard" and "acs_rds_dashboard". For more information, see [Metrics Reference](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28619.htm).
* `metric` - (Required, ForceNew) Name of the monitoring metrics corresponding to a project, such as "CPUUtilization" and "networkin_rate". For more information, see [Metrics Reference](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28619.htm).
* `dimensions` - (Required, ForceNew) Map of the resources associated with the alarm rule, such as "instanceId", "device" and "port". Each key's value is a string and it uses comma to split multiple items. For more information, see [Metrics Reference](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28619.htm).
* `period` - Index query cycle, which must be consistent with that defined for metrics. Default to 300, in seconds.
* `escalations_critical` - (Optional, Available in 1.94.0+) A configuration of critical alarm (documented below).
* `escalations_warn` - (Optional, Available in 1.94.0+) A configuration of critical warn (documented below).
* `escalations_info` - (Optional, Available in 1.94.0+) A configuration of critical info (documented below).
* `statistics` - It has been deprecated from provider version 1.94.0 and 'escalations_critical.statistics' instead.
* `operator` - It has been deprecated from provider version 1.94.0 and 'escalations_critical.comparison_operator' instead.
* `threshold` - It has been deprecated from provider version 1.94.0 and 'escalations_critical.threshold' instead.
* `triggered_count` - It has been deprecated from provider version 1.94.0 and 'escalations_critical.times' instead.
* `contact_groups` - (Required) List contact groups of the alarm rule, which must have been created on the console.
* `effective_interval` - (Available in 1.50.0+) The interval of effecting alarm rule. It foramt as "hh:mm-hh:mm", like "0:00-4:00". Default to "00:00-23:59".
* `start_time` - It has been deprecated from provider version 1.50.0 and 'effective_interval' instead.
* `end_time` - It has been deprecated from provider version 1.50.0 and 'effective_interval' instead.
* `silence_time` - Notification silence period in the alarm state, in seconds. Valid value range: [300, 86400]. Default to 86400
* `notify_type` - Notification type. Valid value [0, 1]. The value 0 indicates TradeManager+email, and the value 1 indicates that TradeManager+email+SMS
