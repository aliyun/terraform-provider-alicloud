# alicloud\_cms\_alarm

This resource provides a alarm rule resource and it can be used to monitor several cloud services according different metrics.
Details for [alarm rule](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28608.htm).

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terraform 
resource "alicloud_cms_alarm" "basic" {
  name              = "tf-testAccCmsAlarm_basic"
  project           = "acs_ecs_dashboard"
  metric_dimensions = "[{\"instanceId\":\"i-bp1247jeep0y53nu3bnk\",\"device\":\"/dev/vda1\"},{\"instanceId\":\"i-bp11gdcik8z6dl5jm84p\",\"device\":\"/dev/vdb1\"}]"
  escalations_critical {
    statistics          = "Average"
    comparison_operator = "<="
    threshold           = 35
    times               = 2
  }
  period             = 900
  contact_groups     = ["test-group"]
  effective_interval = "0:00-2:00"
  webhook            = "https://${data.alicloud_account.current.id}.eu-central-1.fc.aliyuncs.com/2016-08-15/proxy/Terraform/AlarmEndpointMock/"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The alarm rule name.
* `project` - (Required, ForceNew) Monitor project name, such as "acs_ecs_dashboard" and "acs_rds_dashboard". For more information, see [Metrics Reference](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28619.htm).
  **NOTE:** The `dimensions` and `metric_dimensions` must be empty when `project` is `acs_prometheus`, otherwise, one of them must be set.
* `metric` - (Required, ForceNew) Name of the monitoring metrics corresponding to a project, such as "CPUUtilization" and "networkin_rate". For more information, see [Metrics Reference](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28619.htm).
* `dimensions` - (Optional, Computed, Deprecated from 1.173.0+) Field `dimensions` has been deprecated from version 1.95.0. Use `metric_dimensions` instead.
* `period` - (Optional) Index query cycle, which must be consistent with that defined for metrics. Default to 300, in seconds.
* `escalations_critical` - (Optional, Available in 1.94.0+) A configuration of critical alarm (documented below).
* `escalations_warn` - (Optional, Available in 1.94.0+) A configuration of critical warn (documented below).
* `escalations_info` - (Optional, Available in 1.94.0+) A configuration of critical info (documented below).
* `statistics` - (Optional,Deprecated) It has been deprecated from provider version 1.94.0 and 'escalations_critical.statistics' instead.
* `operator` - (Optional,Deprecated) It has been deprecated from provider version 1.94.0 and 'escalations_critical.comparison_operator' instead.
* `threshold` - (Optional,Deprecated) It has been deprecated from provider version 1.94.0 and 'escalations_critical.threshold' instead.
* `triggered_count` - (Optional,Deprecated) It has been deprecated from provider version 1.94.0 and 'escalations_critical.times' instead.
* `contact_groups` - (Required) List contact groups of the alarm rule, which must have been created on the console.
* `effective_interval` - (Available in 1.50.0+) The interval of effecting alarm rule. It format as "hh:mm-hh:mm", like "0:00-4:00". Default to "00:00-23:59".
* `start_time` - (Optional,Deprecated) It has been deprecated from provider version 1.50.0 and 'effective_interval' instead.
* `end_time` - (Optional,Deprecated) It has been deprecated from provider version 1.50.0 and 'effective_interval' instead.
* `silence_time` - (Optional,Deprecated) Notification silence period in the alarm state, in seconds. Valid value range: [300, 86400]. Default to 86400
* `notify_type` - Notification type. Valid value [0, 1]. The value 0 indicates TradeManager+email, and the value 1 indicates that TradeManager+email+SMS
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable alarm rule. Default to true.
* `webhook`- (Optional, Available in 1.46.0+) The webhook that should be called when the alarm is triggered. Currently, only http protocol is supported. Default is empty string.
* `metric_dimensions` - (Optional, Computed, Available in 1.174.0+) Map of the resources associated with the alarm rule, such as "instanceId", "device" and "port". Each key's value is a string, and it uses comma to split multiple items. For more information, see [Metrics Reference](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28619.htm).
* `prometheus` - (Optional, Available in 1.179.0+) The Prometheus alert rule. See the following `Block prometheus`. **Note:** This parameter is required only when you create a Prometheus alert rule for Hybrid Cloud Monitoring.
* `tags` - (Optional, Available in 1.180.0+) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

-> **NOTE:** Each resource supports the creation of one of the following three levels.

#### Block escalations critical alarm

The escalations_critical supports the following:

* `statistics` - Critical level alarm statistics method. It must be consistent with that defined for metrics. Valid values: ["Availability", "Average", "Minimum", "Maximum", "Value", "ErrorCodeMaximum", "Sum", "Count"]. Default to "Average".
* `comparison_operator` - Critical level alarm comparison operator. Valid values: ["<=", "<", ">", ">=", "==", "!="]. Default to "==".
* `threshold` - Critical level alarm threshold value, which must be a numeric value currently.
* `times` - Critical level alarm retry times. Default to 3.

#### Block escalations warn alarm

The escalations_warn supports the following:

* `statistics` - Critical level alarm statistics method. It must be consistent with that defined for metrics. Valid values: ["Availability","Average", "Minimum", "Maximum", "Value", "ErrorCodeMaximum", "Sum", "Count"]. Default to "Average".
* `comparison_operator` - Critical level alarm comparison operator. Valid values: ["<=", "<", ">", ">=", "==", "!="]. Default to "==".
* `threshold` - Critical level alarm threshold value, which must be a numeric value currently.
* `times` - Critical level alarm retry times. Default to 3.

#### Block escalations info alarm

The escalations_info supports the following:

* `statistics` - Critical level alarm statistics method. It must be consistent with that defined for metrics. Valid values: ["Availability","Average", "Minimum", "Maximum", "Value", "ErrorCodeMaximum", "Sum", "Count"]. Default to "Average".
* `comparison_operator` - Critical level alarm comparison operator. Valid values: ["<=", "<", ">", ">=", "==", "!="]. Default to "==".
* `threshold` - Critical level alarm threshold value, which must be a numeric value currently.
* `times` - Critical level alarm retry times. Default to 3.

#### Block prometheus

The prometheus supports the following:

* `prom_ql` - The PromQL query statement. **Note:** The data obtained by using the PromQL query statement is the monitoring data. You must include the alert threshold in this statement.
* `level` - The level of the alert. Valid values: `Critical`, `Warn`, `Info`.
* `times` - The number of consecutive triggers. If the number of times that the metric values meet the trigger conditions reaches the value of this parameter, CloudMonitor sends alert notifications.
* `annotations` - The annotations of the Prometheus alert rule. When a Prometheus alert is triggered, the system renders the annotated keys and values to help you understand the metrics and alert rule.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the alarm rule.
* `status` - The current alarm rule status.

### Timeouts

**NOTE:** Available in v1.163.0+.

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 1 mins) Used when create the alarm rule.
* `update` - (Defaults to 1 mins) Used when update the alarm rule.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 1 mins) Used when delete the alarm rule.

## Import

Alarm rule can be imported using the id, e.g.

```
$ terraform import alicloud_cms_alarm.alarm abc12345
```
