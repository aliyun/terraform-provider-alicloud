# alicloud\_ram\_access\_key

Provides a RAM User access key resource.

-> **NOTE:**  You should set the `secret_file` if you want to get the access key.  

-> **NOTE:**  From version 1.98.0, if not set `pgp_key`, the resource will output the access key secret to field `secret` and please protect your backend state file judiciously

## Example Usage

Output the secret to a file.
```terraform
# Create a new RAM access key for user.
resource "alicloud_ram_user" "user" {
  name         = "user_test"
  display_name = "user_display_name"
  mobile       = "86-18688888888"
  email        = "hello.uuu@aaa.com"
  comments     = "yoyoyo"
  force        = true
}

resource "alicloud_ram_access_key" "ak" {
  user_name   = alicloud_ram_user.user.name
  secret_file = "/xxx/xxx/xxx.txt"
}
```

Using `pgp_key` to encrypt the secret.
```terraform
# Create a new RAM access key for user.
resource "alicloud_ram_user" "user" {
  name         = "user_test"
  display_name = "user_display_name"
  mobile       = "86-18688888888"
  email        = "hello.uuu@aaa.com"
  comments     = "yoyoyo"
  force        = true
}

resource "alicloud_ram_access_key" "encrypt" {
  user_name   = alicloud_ram_user.user.name
  pgp_key = "keybase:some_person_that_exists"
}

output "secret" {
  value = alicloud_ram_access_key.encrypt.encrypted_secret
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `user_name` - (Optional, ForceNew) Name of the RAM user. This name can have a string of 1 to 64 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, such as "-",".","_", and must not begin with a hyphen.
* `secret_file` - (Optional, ForceNew) The name of file that can save access key id and access key secret. Strongly suggest you to specified it when you creating access key, otherwise, you wouldn't get its secret ever.
* `status` - (Optional) Status of access key. It must be `Active` or `Inactive`. Default value is `Active`.
* `pgp_key` - (Optional, Available in 1.47.0+) Either a base-64 encoded PGP public key, or a keybase username in the form `keybase:some_person_that_exists`

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The access key ID.
* `status` - The access key status.
* `secret` (Available in 1.98.0+) - The secret access key. Note that this will be written to the state file. 
If you use this, please protect your backend state file judiciously. 
Alternatively, you may supply a `pgp_key` instead, which will prevent the secret from being stored in plaintext, 
at the cost of preventing the use of the secret key in automation.
* `key_fingerprint` - The fingerprint of the PGP key used to encrypt the secret
* `encrypted_secret` - The encrypted secret, base64 encoded. ~> NOTE: The encrypted secret may be decrypted using the command line, for example: `terraform output encrypted_secret | base64 --decode | keybase pgp decrypt`.
