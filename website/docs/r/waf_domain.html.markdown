  domain            = "www.aliyun.com"
  instance_id       = "waf-123455"
  is_access_product = "On"
  source_ips        = ["1.1.1.1"]
  cluster_type      = "PhysicalCluster"
  http2_port        = [443]
  http_port         = [80]
  https_port        = [443]
  http_to_user_ip   = "Off"
  https_redirect    = "Off"
  load_balancing    = "IpHash"
  log_headers {

* `load_balancing` - (Optional) The load balancing algorithm that is used to forward requests to the origin. Valid values: `IpHash` and `RoundRobin`. Default to `IpHash`.
* `log_headers` - (Optional) The key-value pair that is used to mark the traffic that flows through WAF to the domain. Each item contains two field:
   * key: The key of label
   * value: The value of label
   
* `read_time` - (Optional) The read timeout of a WAF exclusive cluster. Unit: seconds.
* `resource_group_id` - (Optional) The ID of the resource group to which the queried domain belongs in Resource Management. By default, no value is specified, indicating that the domain belongs to the default resource group.
* `source_ips` - (Optional) List of the IP address or domain of the origin server to which the specified domain points.
* `write_time` - (Optional) The timeout period for a WAF exclusive cluster write connection. Unit: seconds.
