# alicloud\_cs\_kubernetes\_node\_pool

This resource will help you to manager node pool in Kubernetes Cluster. 

-> **NOTE:** Available in 1.97.0+.

## Example Usage

node_pool in Kubernetes Cluster

```terraform
resource "alicloud_cs_kubernetes_node_pool" "default" {
  cluster_id              = var.cluster_id
  name                    = "my-node-pool"
  vswitch_ids             = ["alicloud_vswitch.default.id"]
  instance_types          = ["data.alicloud_instance_types.default.instance_types.0.id"]
  cool_down_duration      = "var.cool_down_duration"
  node_count              = 2
}
```


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cluster_id` - (Required) The id of kubernetes cluster.
* `name` - (Required) The name of node pool.
* `vswitch_ids` - (Required) The vswitches used by node pool workers.
* `instance_types` (Required) The instance type of worker node.
* `node_count` (Required) The worker node number of the node pool.
* `password` - (Required, Sensitive) The password of ssh login cluster node. You have to specify one of `password` `key_name` `kms_encrypted_password` fields.
* `key_name` - (Required) The keypair of ssh login cluster node, you have to create it first. You have to specify one of `password` `key_name` `kms_encrypted_password` fields.
* `kms_encrypted_password` - (Required) An KMS encrypts password used to a cs kubernetes. You have to specify one of `password` `key_name` `kms_encrypted_password` fields.
* `system_disk_category` - (Optional) The system disk category of worker node. Its valid value are `cloud_ssd` and `cloud_efficiency`. Default to `cloud_efficiency`.
* `system_disk_size` - (Optional) The system disk category of worker node. Its valid value are `cloud_ssd` and `cloud_efficiency`. Default to `cloud_efficiency`.
* `worker_data_disks` - (Optional) The data disk configurations of worker nodes, such as the disk type and disk size. 
  - category: the type of the data disks. Valid values:
      + cloud: basic disks.
      + cloud_efficiency: ultra disks.
      + cloud_ssd: SSDs.
  - size: the size of a data disk. Unit: GiB.
  - encrypted: specifies whether to encrypt data disks. Valid values: true and false.
* `security_group_id` - (Optional) The system disk size of worker node. Its valid value range [20~32768] in GB. Default to 40.
* `image_id` - (Optional) Custom Image support. Must based on CentOS7 or AliyunLinux2.
* `node_name_mode` - (Optional) Each node name consists of a prefix, an IP substring, and a suffix. For example "customized,aliyun.com,5,test", if the node IP address is 192.168.0.55, the prefix is aliyun.com, IP substring length is 5, and the suffix is test, the node name will be aliyun.com00055test.
* `user_data` - (Optional) Windows instances support batch and PowerShell scripts. If your script file is larger than 1 KB, we recommend that you upload the script to Object Storage Service (OSS) and pull it through the internal endpoint of your OSS bucket.
* `tags` - (Optional) A List of tags to assign to the resource. It will be applied for ECS instances finally.
    - key: It can be up to 64 characters in length. It cannot begin with "aliyun", "http://", or "https://". It cannot be a null string.
    - value: It can be up to 128 characters in length. It cannot begin with "aliyun", "http://", or "https://" It can be a null string.
* `labels` - (Optional) A List of Kubernetes labels to assign to the nodes . Only labels that are applied with the ACK API are managed by this argument.
* `taints` - (Optional) A List of Kubernetes taints to assign to the nodes.


### Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 90 mins) Used when creating node-pool in the kubernetes cluster (until it reaches the initial `active` status). 
* `update` - (Defaults to 60 mins) Used when activating the node-pool in the kubernetes cluster when necessary during update.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 60 mins) Used when deleting node-pool in kubernetes cluster.

* `availability_zone` - The ID of availability zone.
* `vpc_id` - The ID of VPC where the current cluster is located.
* `slb_intranet` - The ID of private load balancer where the current cluster master node is located.
* `security_group_id` - The ID of security group where the current cluster worker node is located.
* `nat_gateway_id` - The ID of nat gateway used to launch kubernetes cluster.
