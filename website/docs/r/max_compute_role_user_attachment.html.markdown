## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* `project_name` - (Required, ForceNew) Project Name
* `role_name` - (Required, ForceNew) Role Name, Valid Values: super_administrator, admin, Custom Role

The Super Administrator of the project has the permission to operate all resources in the project and the management permission. Project owners or users with the Super_Administrator role can assign the Super_Administrator role to other users. -- admin: the built-in management role of MaxCompute, which has the permission to operate all resources in the project and some basic management permissions. Project owners can assign the Admin role to other users. -- Custom role: a role that is not built-in to MaxCompute and needs to be customized. You can refer to the role (starting with role_) definition in DataWorks.

-> **NOTE:** -- Alibaba Cloud account: the account registered on the Alibaba Cloud official website. - RAM User: a user created by an Alibaba Cloud account to assist the Alibaba Cloud account to complete data processing. -- RAM role: a RAM role, like a RAM user, is a type of RAM identity. A RAM role is a virtual user that does not have a specific identity authentication key and needs to be played by a trusted entity user for normal use.
