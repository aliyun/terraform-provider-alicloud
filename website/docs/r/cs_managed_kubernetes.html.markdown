  Provides a Alicloud resource to manage container managed kubernetes cluster.
---

# alicloud\_cs\_managed\_kubernetes

This resource will help you to manager a Managed Kubernetes Cluster. The cluster is same as container service created by web console.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.53.0, we provide `force_update`. When you want to change `worker_instance_types` and `vswitch_ids`, you have to set this field to true, then the cluster will be recreated.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.53.0, `worker_numbers` is deprecated, you should use `worker_number` to indicate a total number of workers.

-> **NOTE:** Managed Kubernetes cluster can support multiple availability zones. Arguments `vswitch_ids`, `worker_instance_types` are string arrays.

-> **NOTE:** Managed Kubernetes cluster only supports VPC network and it can access internet while creating kubernetes cluster.
A Nat Gateway and configuring a SNAT for it can ensure one VPC network access internet. If there is no nat gateway in the
VPC, you can set `new_nat_gateway` to "true" to create one automatically.

-> **NOTE:** Creating managed kubernetes cluster need to install several packages and it will cost about 10 minutes. Please be patient.

-> **NOTE:** The provider supports to download kube config, client certificate, client key and cluster ca certificate
after creating cluster successfully, and you can put them into the specified location, like '~/.kube/config'.

-> **NOTE:** If you want to manage managed Kubernetes, you can use [Kubernetes Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/index.html).

-> **NOTE:** You need to activate several other products and confirm Authorization Policy used by Container Service before using this resource.
Please refer to the `Authorization management` and `Cluster management` sections in the [Document Center](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/86488.htm).
