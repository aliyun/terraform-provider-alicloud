  Provides a Alicloud resource to manage container managed kubernetes cluster.

# alicloud_cs_managed_kubernetes

This resource will help you to manage a ManagedKubernetes Cluster in Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes Service. 

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.26.0.

-> **NOTE:** It is recommended to create a cluster with zero worker nodes, and then use a node pool to manage the cluster nodes. 

-> **NOTE:** Kubernetes cluster only supports VPC network and it can access internet while creating kubernetes cluster.
A Nat Gateway and configuring a SNAT for it can ensure one VPC network access internet. If there is no nat gateway in the
VPC, you can set `new_nat_gateway` to "true" to create one automatically.

-> **NOTE:** Creating kubernetes cluster need to install several packages and it will cost about 15 minutes. Please be patient.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.9.4, the provider supports to download kube config, client certificate, client key and cluster ca certificate
after creating cluster successfully, and you can put them into the specified location, like '~/.kube/config'.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.20.0, the provider supports disabling internet load balancer for API Server by setting `false` to `slb_internet_enabled`.

-> **NOTE:** If you want to manage Kubernetes, you can use [Kubernetes Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/index.html).

-> **NOTE:** You need to activate several other products and confirm Authorization Policy used by Container Service before using this resource.
Please refer to the `Authorization management` and `Cluster management` sections in the [Document Center](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/86488.htm).

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.72.0, Some parameters have been removed from resource,You can check them below and re-import the cluster if necessary.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.120.0, Support for cluster migration from Standard cluster to professional.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.177.0+, `runtime`,`enable_ssh`,`rds_instances`,`exclude_autoscaler_nodes`,`worker_number`,`worker_instance_types`,`password`,`key_name`,`kms_encrypted_password`,`kms_encryption_context`,`worker_instance_charge_type`,`worker_period`,`worker_period_unit`,`worker_auto_renew`,`worker_auto_renew_period`,`worker_disk_category`,`worker_disk_size`,`worker_data_disks`,`node_name_mode`,`node_port_range`,`os_type`,`platform`,`image_id`,`cpu_policy`,`user_data`,`taints`,`worker_disk_performance_level`,`worker_disk_snapshot_policy_id`,`install_cloud_monitor` are deprecated.
We Suggest you using resource **`alicloud_cs_kubernetes_node_pool`** to manage your cluster worker nodes.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.212.0, `runtime`,`enable_ssh`,`rds_instances`,`exclude_autoscaler_nodes`,`worker_number`,`worker_instance_types`,`password`,`key_name`,`kms_encrypted_password`,`kms_encryption_context`,`worker_instance_charge_type`,`worker_period`,`worker_period_unit`,`worker_auto_renew`,`worker_auto_renew_period`,`worker_disk_category`,`worker_disk_size`,`worker_data_disks`,`node_name_mode`,`node_port_range`,`os_type`,`platform`,`image_id`,`cpu_policy`,`user_data`,`taints`,`worker_disk_performance_level`,`worker_disk_snapshot_policy_id`,`install_cloud_monitor`,`kube_config`,`availability_zone` are removed.
Please use resource **`alicloud_cs_kubernetes_node_pool`** to manage your cluster worker nodes.

```

### worker_vswitch_ids

The following example is the definition of `worker_vswitch_ids` block.

```
  # the ID can be the same, At least one.

  worker_vswitch_ids = ["vsw-id1", "vsw-id1", "vsw-id2"]
```

### `delete_options`

The following arguments are supported in the `delete_options` configuration block:
* `delete_mode` - (Optional) The deletion mode of the cluster. Different resources may have different default behavior, see `resource_type` for details. Valid values:
  - `delete`: delete resources created by the cluster.
