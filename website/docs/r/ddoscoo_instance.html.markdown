# alicloud_ddoscoo_instance

Provides a BGP-line Anti-DDoS Pro(DdosCoo) Instance resource.

For information about BGP-line Anti-DDoS Pro(DdosCoo) Instance and how to use it, see [What is Anti-DDoS Pro Instance](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ddos-protection/latest/create-an-anti-ddos-pro-or-anti-ddos-premium-instance-by-calling-an-api-operation).

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.37.0.

-> **NOTE:** The endpoint of bssopenapi used only support "business.aliyuncs.com" at present.

-> **NOTE:** From version 1.214.0, if `product_type` is set to `ddoscoo` or `ddoscoo_intl`, the provider `region` should be set to `cn-hangzhou`, and if `product_type` is set to `ddosDip`, the provider `region` should be set to `ap-southeast-1`.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terraform
provider "alicloud" {
  region = "cn-hangzhou"
}

variable "name" {
  default = "tf-example"
}

resource "alicloud_ddoscoo_instance" "default" {
  name              = var.name
  base_bandwidth    = "30"
  bandwidth         = "30"
  service_bandwidth = "100"
  port_count        = "50"
  domain_count      = "50"
  product_type      = "ddoscoo"
  period            = "1"
}
```
