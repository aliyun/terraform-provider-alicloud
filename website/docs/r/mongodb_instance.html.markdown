# alicloud\_mongodb\_instance

Provides a MongoDB instance resource supports replica set instances only. the MongoDB provides stable, reliable, and automatic scalable database services. 
It offers a full range of database solutions, such as disaster recovery, backup, recovery, monitoring, and alarms.
You can see detail product introduction [here](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/26558.htm)

-> **NOTE:**  Available in 1.37.0+

-> **NOTE:**  The following regions don't support create Classic network MongoDB instance.
[`cn-zhangjiakou`,`cn-huhehaote`,`ap-southeast-2`,`ap-southeast-3`,`ap-southeast-5`,`ap-south-1`,`me-east-1`,`ap-northeast-1`,`eu-west-1`] 

-> **NOTE:**  Create MongoDB instance or change instance type and storage would cost 5~10 minutes. Please make full preparation

## Example Usage

### Create a Mongodb instance

```
data "alicloud_zones" "default" {
  available_resource_creation = "MongoDB"
}

resource "alicloud_vpc" "default" {
  name       = "vpc-123456"
  cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/16"
}

resource "alicloud_vswitch" "default" {
  vpc_id            = "${alicloud_vpc.default.id}"
  cidr_block        = "172.16.0.0/24"
  availability_zone = "${data.alicloud_zones.default.zones.0.id}"
  name              = "vpc-123456"
}

resource "alicloud_mongodb_instance" "example" {
  engine_version      = "3.4"
  db_instance_class   = "dds.mongo.mid"
  db_instance_storage = 10
  vswitch_id          = "${alicloud_vswitch.default.id}"
  security_ip_list    = ["10.168.1.12", "100.69.7.112"]
}

```

  - Custom storage space; value range: [10,2000]
  - 10-GB increments. 
* `replication_factor` - (Optional) Number of replica set nodes. Valid values: [3,5,7]
* `storage_engine` (Optional, ForceNew) Storage engine: WiredTiger or RocksDB. System Default value: WiredTiger.
* `name` - (Optional) The name of DB instance. It a string of 2 to 256 characters.

* `period` - (Optional) The duration that you will buy DB instance (in month). It is valid when instance_charge_type is `PrePaid`. Valid values: [1~9], 12, 24, 36. System default to 1.
* `zone_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) The Zone to launch the DB instance. it supports multiple zone.
If it is a multi-zone and `vswitch_id` is specified, the vswitch must in one of them.
The multiple zone ID can be retrieved by setting `multi` to "true" in the data source `alicloud_zones`.
