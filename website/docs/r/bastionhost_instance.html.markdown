## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terraform
resource "alicloud_bastionhost_instance" "default" {
  description        = "Terraform-test"
  license_code       = "bhah_ent_50_asset"
  period             = "1"
  vswitch_id         = "v-testVswitch"
  security_group_ids = ["sg-test", "sg-12345"]
}
```

```terraform
data "alicloud_resource_manager_resource_groups" "default" {
  status = "OK"
}
resource "alicloud_bastionhost_instance" "default" {
  description        = "Terraform-test"
  license_code       = "bhah_ent_50_asset"
  period             = 1
  security_group_ids = [alicloud_security_group.default.0.id, alicloud_security_group.default.1.id]
  vswitch_id         = "v-testVswitch"
  resource_group_id  = data.alicloud_resource_manager_resource_groups.default.ids.0
  ad_auth_server {
    server         = "192.168.1.1"
    standby_server = "192.168.1.3"
    port           = "80"

    is_ssl             = false
    base_dn            = "dc=test,dc=com"

  }
}
```

### Deleting `alicloud_bastionhost_instance` or removing it from your configuration

The `alicloud_bastionhost_instance` resource allows you to manage bastionhost instance, but Terraform cannot destroy it.
Deleting the subscription resource or removing it from your configuration
will remove it from your state file and management, but will not destroy the bastionhost instance.
You can resume managing the subscription bastionhost instance via the AlibabaCloud Console.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `license_code` - (Required)  The package type of Cloud Bastionhost instance. You can query more supported types through the [DescribePricingModule](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/96469.html).
* `description` - (Required) Description of the instance. This name can have a string of 1 to 63 characters.
* `period` - (Optional) Duration for initially producing the instance. Valid values: [1~9], 12, 24, 36. At present, the provider does not support modify "period".
-> **NOTE:** The attribute `period` is only used to create Subscription instance or modify the PayAsYouGo instance to Subscription. Once effect, it will not be modified that means running `terraform apply` will not effect the resource.
* `vswitch_id` - (Required, ForceNew) VSwitch ID configured to Bastionhost.
* `security_group_ids` - (Required) security group IDs configured to Bastionhost. 
  **NOTE:** There is a potential diff error because of the order of `security_group_ids` values indefinite.
  So, from version 1.160.0, `security_group_ids` type has been updated as `set` from `list`,
  and you can use [tolist](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/tolist) to convert it to a list.
* `tags` - (Optional, Available in v1.67.0+) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
* `resource_group_id` - (Optional, Available in v1.87.0+) The Id of resource group which the Bastionhost Instance belongs. If not set, the resource is created in the default resource group.
* `enable_public_access` - (Optional, Available in v1.143.0+)  Whether to Enable the public internet access to a specified Bastionhost instance. The valid values: `true`, `false`.
* `ad_auth_server` - (Optional, Available from 1.169.0+) The AD auth server of the Instance. See the following `Block ad_auth_server`.
* `ldap_auth_server` - (Optional, Available from 1.169.0+) The LDAP auth server of the Instance. See the following `Block ldap_auth_server`.
* `renew_period` - (Optional, ForceNew, Available from 1.187.0+) Automatic renewal period. Valid values: `1` to `9`, `12`, `24`, `36`. **NOTE:** The `renew_period` is required under the condition that renewal_status is `AutoRenewal`. 
* `renewal_status` - (Optional, Computed, ForceNew, Available from 1.187.0+) Automatic renewal status. Valid values: `AutoRenewal`,`ManualRenewal`. 

-> **NOTE:** You can utilize the generic Terraform resource [lifecycle configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html) with `ad_auth_server` or `ldap_auth_server` to configure auth server, then ignore any changes to that `password` caused externally (e.g. Application Autoscaling).
```
  # ... ignore the change about ad_auth_server.0.password and ldap_auth_server.0.password in alicloud_bastionhost_instance
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [ad_auth_server.0.password,ldap_auth_server.0.password]
  }
```
