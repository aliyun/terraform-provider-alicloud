# alicloud\_ram\_role

Provides a RAM Role resource.

-> **NOTE:** When you want to destroy this resource forcefully(means remove all the relationships associated with it automatically and then destroy it) without set `force`  with `true` at beginning, you need add `force = true` to configuration file and run `terraform plan`, then you can delete resource forcefully.

## Example Usage

```
# Create a new RAM Role.
resource "alicloud_ram_role" "role" {
  name     = "testrole"
  document = <<EOF
  {

      {
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": [
            "apigateway.aliyuncs.com", 
            "ecs.aliyuncs.com"
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "Version": "1"
  }
  EOF
  description = "this is a role test."
  force = true
}
```
