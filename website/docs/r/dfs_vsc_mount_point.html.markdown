## Example Usage

Basic Usage

```terraform
variable "name" {
  default = "terraform-example"
}

provider "alicloud" {
  region = "cn-hangzhou"
}

resource "random_integer" "default" {
  min = 10000
  max = 99999
}

data "alicloud_dfs_zones" "default" {}

locals {
  zone_id      = data.alicloud_dfs_zones.default.zones.0.zone_id
  storage_type = data.alicloud_dfs_zones.default.zones.0.options.0.storage_type
}

resource "alicloud_dfs_file_system" "default" {
  protocol_type                    = "HDFS"
  description                      = var.name
  file_system_name                 = "${var.name}-${random_integer.default.result}"
  space_capacity                   = "1024"
  throughput_mode                  = "Provisioned"
  provisioned_throughput_in_mi_bps = "512"
  storage_type                     = local.storage_type
  zone_id                          = local.zone_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* `alias_prefix` - (Optional) Mount point alias prefix, which is used as the prefix for generating VSC mount point aliases.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the Mount point.  The length is 0 to 100 characters.
* `file_system_id` - (Required, ForceNew) The ID of the HDFS file system resource associated with the VSC mount point.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:
* `id` - The ID of the resource supplied above.The value is formulated as `<file_system_id>:<mount_point_id>`.
* `instances` - The collection of ECS instances on which the HDFS file system is mounted.
  * `status` - The status of the ECS instance on which the HDFS file system is mounted.
  * `vscs` - The VSC list of mounted HDFS file systems.
    * `vsc_id` - VSC Channel primary key representation, used to retrieve the specified VSC Channel.
    * `vsc_status` - VSC Mount status.
    * `vsc_type` - The VSC type.
  * `instance_id` -The ID of the ECS instance to which the HDFS file system is mounted.
* `mount_point_id` - VSC mount point ID, which is the unique identifier of the vsc mount point and is used to access the associated HDFS file system.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:
* `create` - (Defaults to 5 mins) Used when create the Vsc Mount Point.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 5 mins) Used when delete the Vsc Mount Point.
* `update` - (Defaults to 5 mins) Used when update the Vsc Mount Point.

## Import

DFS Vsc Mount Point can be imported using the id, e.g.
