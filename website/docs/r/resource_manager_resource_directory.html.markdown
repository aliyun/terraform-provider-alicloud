# alicloud\_resource\_manager\_resource\_directory

Provides a Resource Manager Resource Directory resource. Resource Directory enables you to establish an organizational structure for the resources used by applications of your enterprise. You can plan, build, and manage the resources in a centralized manner by using only one resource directory.

For information about Resource Manager Resource Directory and how to use it, see [What is Resource Manager Resource Directory](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/94475.htm).

-> **NOTE:** Available in v1.84.0+.

-> **NOTE:** An account can only be used to enable a resource directory after it passes enterprise real-name verification. An account that only passed individual real-name verification cannot be used to enable a resource directory.
