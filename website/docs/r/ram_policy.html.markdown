# alicloud_ram_policy

Provides a RAM Policy resource.



For information about RAM Policy and how to use it, see [What is Policy](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ram/developer-reference/api-ram-2015-05-01-createpolicy).

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.0.0.

-> **NOTE:** When you want to destroy this resource forcefully(means remove all the relationships associated with it automatically and then destroy it) without set `force`  with `true` at beginning, you need add `force = true` to configuration file and run `terraform plan`, then you can delete resource forcefully.

-> **NOTE:** Each policy can own at most 5 versions and the oldest version will be removed after its version achieves 5.

-> **NOTE:** If the policy has multiple versions, all non-default versions will be deleted first when deleting policy.
