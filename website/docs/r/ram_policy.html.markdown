# alicloud_ram_policy

Provides a RAM Policy resource. 

-> **NOTE:** When you want to destroy this resource forcefully(means remove all the relationships associated with it automatically and then destroy it) without set `force`  with `true` at beginning, you need add `force = true` to configuration file and run `terraform plan`, then you can delete resource forcefully.

-> **NOTE:** Each policy can own at most 5 versions and the oldest version will be removed after its version achieves 5.

-> **NOTE:** If the policy has multiple versions, all non-default versions will be deleted first when deleting policy.

-> **NOTE:** Available since v1.0.0+.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a new RAM Policy.
resource "random_integer" "default" {
  min = 10000
  max = 99999
}

resource "alicloud_ram_policy" "policy" {
  policy_name     = "tf-example-${random_integer.default.result}"
  policy_document = <<EOF
  {
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Action": [
          "oss:ListObjects",
          "oss:GetObject"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": [
          "acs:oss:*:*:mybucket",
          "acs:oss:*:*:mybucket/*"
        ]
      }
    ],
      "Version": "1"
  }
  EOF
  description     = "this is a policy test"
}
```
