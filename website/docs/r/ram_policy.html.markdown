# alicloud\_ram\_policy

Provides a RAM Policy resource. 

-> **NOTE:** When you want to destroy this resource forcefully(means remove all the relationships associated with it automatically and then destroy it) without set `force`  with `true` at beginning, you need add `force = true` to configuration file and run `terraform plan`, then you can delete resource forcefully.
-> **NOTE:** Each policy can own at most 5 versions and the oldest version will be removed after its version achieves 5.

## Example Usage

```
# Create a new RAM Policy.
resource "alicloud_ram_policy" "policy" {
  name     = "policyName"
  document = <<EOF
  {
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Action": [
          "oss:ListObjects",
          "oss:GetObject"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": [
          "acs:oss:*:*:mybucket",
          "acs:oss:*:*:mybucket/*"
        ]
      }
    ],
      "Version": "1"
  }
  EOF
  description = "this is a policy test"
  force = true
}
